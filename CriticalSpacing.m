function oo=CriticalSpacing(oIn)
% o=CriticalSpacing(o);
% CriticalSpacing measures an observer's critical spacing and acuity (i.e.
% threshold spacing and size) to help characterize the observer's vision.
% This program takes over your screen to measure the observer's size or
% spacing threshold for letter identification. It takes about 5 minutes to
% measure two thresholds. It's meant to be called by a short user-written
% script, and should work well in clinical environments. All results are
% returned in the "o" struct and also saved to disk in two files whose file
% names include your script name, the experimenter and observer names, and
% the date. One of those files is plain text .txt and easy for you to read;
% the other is a MATLAB save file .MAT and easily read by MATLAB programs.
% It's best to keep both. The filenames are unique and easy to sort, so
% it's fine to let all your data files accumulate in your
% CriticalSpacing/data/ folder.
%
% THE "o" ARGUMENT, INPUT AND OUTPUT. You define a condition by creating an
% "o" struct and setting its fields to specify your testing condition. Call
% CriticalSpacing, passing the "o" struct. CriticalSpacing will measure a
% threshold for your condition and return the "o" struct including all the
% results as additional fields. CriticalSpacing may adjust some of your
% parameters to satisfy physical constraints including screen size and
% maximum possible contrast. If you provide several conditions, as an o
% array, then CriticalSpacing runs all the conditions randomly interleaved,
% measuring a threshold for each. I sometimes pass two identical conditions
% to get two thresholds for the same condition.
%
% USER-WRITTEN SCRIPTS. CriticalSpacing.m is meant to be driven by a brief
% user-written script. Your run script is short and very easy to write. It
% just assigns values to the fields of an "o" struct and then calls
% CriticalSpacing to measure a threshold. I have provided
% runCriticalSpacing as an example. You control the behavior of
% CriticalSpacing by setting parameters in the fields the "o" struct. "o"
% defines a condition for which a threshold will be measured. If you
% provide several conditions, as an o array, then CriticalSpacing runs all
% the conditions interleaved, measuring a threshold for each.
% CriticalSpacing initially confirms the viewing distance, asks for the
% experimenter's and observer's names, and presents a page of instructions.
% The rest is just one eye chart after another, each showing one or two
% targets (with or without repetitions). Presentation can be brief or
% static (o.durationSec=inf).
%
% RUN A SCRIPT. To test an observer, double click "runCriticalSpacing.m" or
% your own modified script. They're easy to write. Say "Ok" if MATLAB
% offers to change the current folder. CriticalSpacing automatically saves
% your results to the "CriticalSpacing/data" folder. The data filenames are
% unique and intuitive, so it's ok to let lots of data accumulate in the
% data folder. runCriticalSpacing takes 5 min to test one observer (with 20
% trials per threshold), measuring two thresholds, interleaved.

% It's open access. Download freely.
%
% INSTALL. To install and run CriticalSpacing on your computer:
% Download the CriticalSpacing software from
% https://github.com/denispelli/CriticalSpacing/archive/master.zip
% Unpack the zip archive, producing a folder called CriticalSpacing. Inside
% the CriticalSpacing folder, open the Word document "Install
% CriticalSpacing.docx" for detailed instructions for installation of
% MATLAB, Psychtoolbox, and CriticalSpacing software. Install. Type "help
% CriticalSpacing" in the MATLAB Command Window.
%
% PRINT THE ALPHABET ON PAPER. Choose a font from those available in the
% CriticalSpacing/pdf/ folder. They are all available when you set
% o.readAlphabetFromDisk=1. We have done most of our work with the "Sloan"
% and "Pelli" fonts. Only Pelli is skinny enough to measure foveal
% crowding. Outside the fovea you can use any font. We recommend "Pelli"
% for threshold spacing (crowding) in the fovea, and Sloan for threshold
% size (acuity) anywhere. Print the PDF for your font, e.g. "Pelli
% alphabet.pdf" or "Sloan alphabet.pdf". Give the printed alphabet page to
% your observer. It shows the possible letters, e.g. "DHKNORSVZ" or
% "1234567889". Most observers will find it helpful to consult this page
% while choosing an answer, especially when they are guessing. And children
% may prefer to respond by pointing at the printed target letters on the
% alphabet page. However, patients who have trouble directing their
% attention may be better off without the paper, to give their undivided
% attention to the display.
%
% DISPLAY ALPHABET ON SCREEN. Anytime you press the "caps lock" key,
% CriticalSpacing will display the alphabet of possible responses in the
% current font. Like the printed version, it shows the nine possible
% letters or digits. This may help observers choose an answer, especially
% when they are guessing.
%
% MATLAB AND PSYCHTOOLBOX. To run this program, you need a computer with
% MATLAB (or Octave) and the Psychtoolbox installed. The computer OS can be
% OS X, Windows, or Linux. MATLAB is commercially available, and many
% universites have site licences. Psychtoolbox is free.
% https://www.mathworks.com/
% http://psychtoolbox.org/
% 
% OPTIONAL: MEASURE YOUR SCREEN SIZE IN CM. Psychtoolbox automatically
% reads your display screen's resolution in pixels and size in cm, and
% reports them in every data file. Alas, the reported size in cm is
% sometimes (very) wrong in Windows, and is not always available for
% external monitors under any OS. So we allow users to measure the display
% screen size themselves and provide it in the "o" struct as
% o.measuredScreenWidthCm and o.measuredScreenWidthCm. Use a meter stick to
% measure the width and height of your screen's rectangle of glowing
% pixels.

% MAC OS X: PERMIT MATLAB TO CONTROL YOUR COMPUTER. Open the System
% Preferences: Security and Privacy: Privacy tab. Select Accessibility.
% Click to open the lock in lower left, providing your computer password.
% Click to select MATLAB, allowing it to control your computer. Click the
% lock again to close it.
%
% A WIRELESS OR LONG-CABLE KEYBOARD is highly desirable because a normally
% sighted observer viewing foveally has excellent vision and must be many
% meters away from the screen, and thus will be unable to reach a built-in
% keyboard attached to the screen. If you must use the built-in keyboard,
% then have the experimenter type the observer's verbal answers. I like the
% Logitech K760 $86 solar-powered wireless keyboard, because its batteries
% never run out. It's no longer made, but still available on Amazon and
% eBay (below). To "pair" the keyboard with your computer's blue tooth,
% press the tiny button on the back of the keyboard.

%
% TAPE OR LASER MEASURE FOR VIEWING DISTANCE. The viewing distance will
% typically be several meters, and it's important that you set it
% accurately, within five percent. You can measure it with a $10 tape
% measure marked in centimeters. A fancy $40 alternative is a Bosch laser
% measure, which gives you the answer in two clicks. The laser works even
% with a mirror.

%
% MIRROR. In a small room, you might need a mirror to achieve a long
% viewing distance. When CriticalSpacing asks you about viewing distance,
% you can indicate that you're using a mirror by entering the viewing
% distance as a negative number. It will flip the display to be seen in a
% mirror. (You can also request this, in advance, by setting
% o.flipScreenHorizontally=1; in your run script.) I bought two acrylic
% front surface mirrors for this. 12x24 inches, $46 each from inventables.
% Front surface mirrors preserve image quality, and acrylic is hard to
% break, making it safer than glass. I'm not yet sure how big a mirror one
% needs to accomodate observer's of various heights, so I listed several of
% Amazon's offerings, ranging up to 24" by 48". The five-pack is a good
% deal, five 12"x24" mirrors for $67.

%
% READ ALPHABET FROM DISK. If you set o.readAlphabetFromDisk=1 in your
% script you can use any of the "fonts" inside the
% CriticalSpacing/alphabets/ folder, which you can best see by looking at
% the alphabet files in CriticalSpacing/pdf/. You can easily create and add
% a new "font" to the alphabets folder. Name the folder after your "font",
% and put one image file per letter inside the folder, named for the
% letter. That's it. You can now specify your new "font" as the
% o.targetFont and CriticalSpacing will use it. You can make the drawings
% yourself, or you can run CriticalSpacing/lib/SaveAlphabetToDisk.m to
% create a new folder based on a computer font that you already own. This
% scheme makes it easy to develop a new font, and also makes it easy to
% share font images without violating a font's commercial distribution
% license. (US Copyright law does not cover fonts. Adobe patents the font
% program, but the images are public domain.) You can also ask
% CriticalSpacing to use any font that's installed in your computer OS by
% setting o.readAlphabetFromDisk=0. The Pelli and Sloan fonts are provided
% in the CriticalSpacing/fonts/ folder, and you can install them in your
% computer OS. On a Mac, you can just double-click the font file and say
% "yes" when your computer offers to install it for you. Once you've
% installed a font, you must quit and restart MATLAB to use the newly
% available font.
%
% OPTIONAL: ADD A NEW FONT. Running the program SaveAlphabetToDisk in
% the CriticalSpacing/lib/ folder, after you edit it to specify the font,
% alphabet, and borderCharacter you want, will add a snapshot of your
% font's alphabet to the pdf folder and add a new folder, named for your
% font, to the CriticalSpacing/alphabets/ folder.
%
% OPTIONAL: USE YOUR COMPUTER'S FONTS, LIVE. Set o.readAlphabetFromDisk=0.
% You may wish to install Pelli or Sloan from the CriticalSpacing/fonts/
% folder into your computer's OS. Restart MATLAB after installing a new
% font. To render fonts well, Psychtoolbox needs to load the FTGL DrawText
% dropin. It typically takes some fiddling with dynamic libraries to make
% sure the right library is available and that access to it is not blocked
% by the presence of an obsolete version. For explanation see "help
% drawtextplugin". You need this only if you want to set
% o.readAlphabetFromDisk=0.
%
% CHILDREN. Adults and children seem to find it easy and intuitive. Sarah
% Waugh (Dept. of Vision and Hearing Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University)
% has tested 200 children of ages 4 to 16 (?). To test children, Sarah used
% an fictional astronaut adventure story about this test. The game,
% designed by Aenne Brielmann, in my lab here at NYU, includes an
% illustrated story book and alien dolls.
%
% CHOOSE A VIEWING DISTANCE. You can provide a default in your script, e.g.
% o.viewingDistanceCm=400. CriticalSpacing invites you to modify the
% viewing distance (or declare that you're using a mirror) at the beginning
% of each run. You need long distance to display tiny letters, and you need
% short viewing distance to display peripheral letters, if fixation is
% on-screen. (We plan to add support for off-screen fixation.) When viewing
% foveally, please err on the side of making the viewing distance longer
% than necessary. If you use too short a viewing distance then the minimum
% size and spacing may be bigger than the threshold you want to measure. At
% the end of the run, CriticalSpacing.m warns you if the estimated
% threshold is smaller than the minimum possible size or spacing at the
% current distance, and suggests that you increase the viewing distance in
% subsequent runs. The minimum viewing distance depends on the smallest
% letter size you want to show with 8 pixels and the resolution (pixels per
% centimeter) of your display. This is Eq. 4 in the Pelli et al. (2016)
% paper cited at the beginning,
%
% minViewingDistanceCm=57*(minimumTargetPix/letterDeg)/(screenWidthPix/screenWidthCm);
%
% where minimumTargetPix=8 and letterDeg=0.02 for the healthy adult fovea.
%
% PERSPECTIVE DISTORTION IS MINIMIZED BY PLACING THE TARGET AT THE NEAR
% POINT. At the beginning of each run, the CriticalSpacing program gives
% directions to arrange the display so that its "near point" (i.e. point
% closest to the observer's eye) is orthogonal to the observer's line of
% sight. This guarantees minimal effects of perspective distortaion on any
% target placed there. 

% ECCENTRICITY OF THE TARGET. Eccentricity of the target is achieved by
% placing fixation appropriately. Modest eccentricities, up to perhaps 30
% deg, are achieved with on-screen fixation. CriticalSpacing automatically
% chooses the fixation location to allow the target to be as near as
% possible to the center of the display. (More precisely, we place the
% target at the near point and place the near point as close as possible to
% o.nearPointXYInUnitSquare, whose default is 0.5 0.5.) If the eccentricity
% is too large for on-screen fixation, then we help you set up off-screen
% fixation.
%
% HORIZONAL OFF-SCREEN FIXATION. To achieve a large horizontaol
% eccentricity, pick a stable object that has roughly the same height as
% your display, perhaps a can or a cardboard box. Place the sturdy object
% next to your display. (Alternatively, a goose neck clamp, described
% below, could be clamped to a side edge of your display.) Follow the
% instructions of CriticalSpacing to draw a fixation mark, e.g. with a
% black sharpee, on your object at the same height as the cross on the
% screen. CriticalSpacing will tell you how far it should be from the
% on-screen cross (the target location) and how far it shold be from the
% observer's eye. In addition to the sturdy object and marker, you'll need
% a meter stick.
%
% VERTICAL OFF-SCREEN FIXATION. To achieve a large vertical eccentricity, I
% recommend a gooseneck clamp, like the Wimberley PP-200 Plamp II used by
% photographers to hold things.
% https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SCXUZM0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00
% For a negative vertical eccentricity, clamp one end on the top edge of
% your display, and CriticalSpacing will tell you how to position the other
% end, which acts as your fixation mark. For a positive eccentricity, bring
% your display forward to the edge of your table, and clamp the bottom edge
% of the display. You need just the gooseneck clamp and a meter stick.
% 
% NAME THE EXPERIMENTER & OBSERVER. If it doesn't already know,
% CriticalSpacing asks for the name of the experimenter and observer. These
% names are included in the data files, and incorporated into the data file
% names. If your know the experimenter or observer name in advance you can
% specify it in your script, e.g. o.experimenter='Denis' or
% o.observer='JohnK', and CriticalSpacing will skip that question.
%
% CAPS-LOCK KEY: DISPLAY THE ALPHABET. Anytime that CriticalSpacing is
% running trials, pressing the caps lock key will display the font's
% alphabet at a large size, filling the screen. (The shift key works too,
% but it's dangerous on Windows. On Windows, pressing the shift key five
% times provokes a "sticky keys" dialog that you won't see because it's
% hidden behind the CriticalSpacing window, so you'll be stuck. The caps
% lock key is always safe.)
%
% ESCAPE KEY: QUIT. You can always terminate the current run by hitting the
% escape key on your keyboard (typically in upper left, labeled "esc").
% Because at least one computer (e.g. the 2017 MacBook Pro with track bar)
% lacks an ESCAPE key, we accept the GRAVE ACCENT key (also in upper left
% of keyboard) as equivalent. CriticalSpacing will then print out (and save
% to disk) results so far, and ask whether you're quitting the whole
% session or proceeding to the next run. Quitting this run sets the flag
% o.quitRun, and quitting the whole session also sets the flag
% o.quitSession. If o.quitSession is already set when you call
% CriticalSpacing, the CriticalSpacing returns immediately after processing
% arguments. (CriticalSpacing ignores o.quitRun on input.)
%
% SPACE KEY: SKIP THIS TRIAL. To make it easier to test children, we've
% softened the "forced" in forced choice. If you (the experimenter) think
% the observer is overwhelmed by this trial, you can press the spacebar
% instead of a letter and the program will immediately go to the next
% trial, which will be easier. If you skip that trial too, the next will be
% even easier, and so on. However, as soon as a trial gets a normal
% response then Quest will resume presenting trials near threshold. We hope
% skipping will make the initial experience easier. Eventually the child
% must still do trials near threshold, because threshold estimation
% requires it. Skipping is always available. If you type one letter and
% then skip, the typed letter still counts. There's an invisible timer.
% If you hit space (to skip) less than 8 s after the chart appeared, then
% the program says "Skip", and any responses not yet taken do not count. If
% you wait at least 8 s before hitting space, then the program says
% "Space" and, supposing that the child felt too unsure to choose
% knowledgeably, the program helps out by providing a random guess. By
% chance, that guess will occasionally be right. Please do not tell the
% observer about this option to skip. Use this only rarely, when you need
% it to avoid a crisis. In general it's important to set up the right
% expectation at the outset. Warn the observer that this is a game and
% nobody gets them all right. You just try to get as many as you can.
%
% THRESHOLD. CriticalSpacing measures threshold spacing or size (i.e.
% acuity). This program measures threshold spacing in either of two
% directions, selected by the variable o.targetSizeIsHeight, 1 for
% vertically, and 0 for horizontally. Target size can be made proportional
% to spacing, allowing measurement of critical spacing without knowing the
% acuity, because we use the largest possible letter for each spacing. The
% ratio SpacingOverSize is computed for spacing and size along the
% axis specified by o.spaceRadialOrTangential. The final report by
% CriticalSpacing includes the aspect ratio of your font: o.heightOverWidth.
%
% ECCENTRICITY. Set o.eccentricityXYDeg in your script. For peripheral
% testing, it's usually best to set o.durationSec=0.2 to exclude eye
% movements during the brief target presentation. When the flankers are
% radial, the specified spacing refers to the inner flanker, between target
% and fixation. We define scaling eccentricity as eccentricity plus 0.015
% deg. The critical spacing of crowding is proportional to the scaling
% eccentricity The outer flanker is at the scaling eccentricity that has
% the same ratio to the target scaling eccentricity, as the target scaling
% eccentricity does to the inner-flanker scaling eccentricity.
%
% SAVING LETTER-CONFUSION DATA
% For each condition we keep track of which letters the observer has
% trouble with (time and accuracy). This might lead us to adjust or drop
% troublesome letters. We save the letter-confusion and reaction-time
% results of every presentation in a trialData array struct that is a field
% of each condition. The index "i" counts presentations. There may be 1 or
% 2 targets per presentation. If there are two targets (characters), then
% there are two targetScores, responses (characters), responseScores, and
% reactionTimes. targetScores and responseScores are 1 or 0 for each item.
% The responses are in the order typed, at times (since Flip) in
% reactionTimes. reactionTime is nan after the observer views the alphabet
% screen.

% EXPLANATION FROM MARIO KLEINER (2/9/16) ON RESTORING RESOLUTION
% "The current behavior is something like this:
%
% "* On OSX it tries to restore the video mode that was present at the time
% when the user changed video mode the first time in a session via
% Screen('Resolution'), whenever a window gets closed by code or due to
% error. The OS may restore video mode to whatever it thinks makes sense
% also if Matlab/Octave exits or crashes.
%
% "* On Windows some kind of approximation of the above, at the discretion
% of the OS. I don't know if different recent Windows versions could behave
% differently. We tell the OS that the mode we set is dynamic/temporary and
% the OS restores to something meaningful (to it) at error/window close
% time, or probably also at Matlab exit/crash time.
%
% "* Linux X11 approximation of OSX, except in certain multi-display
% configurations where it doesn't auto-restore anything. And a crash/exit
% of Matlab doesn't auto-restore either. Linux with a future Wayland
% display system will likely have a different behavior again, due to
% ongoing design decisions wrt. desktop security.
%
% "It's one of these areas where true cross-platform portability is not
% really possible.
%
% "In my git repo i have a Screen mex file which no longer triggers errors
% during error handling, but just prints an error message if OSX screws up
% in doing its job as an OS:

% PRACTICE PRESENTATIONS.
% In several instances, very young children (4 years old) refused to even
% try to guess the letters when the screen is covered by letters in the
% repeated-letters condition. 8 year olds and adults are unphased. Sarah
% Waugh found that the 4 years olds were willing to identify one or two
% target letters, and we speculated that once they succeeded at that, they
% might be willing to try the repeated-letters condition, with many more
% letters.
%
% You can now request this by setting o.practicePresentations=3. My hope is
% that children will be emboldened by their success on the first three
% trials to succeed on the repeated condition, in which letters cover most
% of the screen.
%
% o.practicePresentations=3 only affects the repeated-targets condition,
% i.e. when o.repeatedTargets=1. This new options adds 3 practice
% presentations at the beginning of every repeatedTargets run. The first
% presentation has only a few target letters (two unique) in a single row.
% Subsequent presentations are similar, until the observer gets both
% targets right. Then it doubles the number of targets. Again it waits for
% the observer to get both targets right, and then doubles the number of
% targets. After 3 successful practice presentations, the official run
% begins. The practice presentation responses are discarded and not passed
% to Quest.
% 
% You can restore the old behavior by setting o.practicePresentations=0.
% After the practice, the run estimates threshold by the same procedure
% whether o.practicePresentation is 0 or 3.
