function InitializePsychSound(reallyneedlowlatency)
% InitializePsychSound([reallyneedlowlatency=0])
%
% This routine loads the PsychPortAudio sound driver for high-precision,
% low-latency, multi-channel sound playback and recording.
%
% Call it at the beginning of your experiment script, optionally providing
% the 'reallyneedlowlatency' flag set to one to push really hard for low
% latency.
%
% On MacOS/X and GNU/Linux, the PsychPortAudio driver will just work with
% low latency and highest timing precision after this initialization.
%
% On Microsoft Windows, things are a bit more complicated:
%
% PsychPortAudio on Windows supports three different Windows sound systems,
% MME, WDM/KS and WASAPI. Only WDM/KS and WASAPI are suitable for research
% grade auditory stimulation with support for multi-channel sound cards and
% for high-precision and low-latency sound timing and time-stamping. If you
% want reliable timing and time-stamping with latencies and accuracy better
% than 500 msecs, you *must* use one of these. By default, in low latency
% mode, WASAPI is used on Windows Vista and later, whereas WDM/KS would be
% used on older Windows versions. WDM/KS is completely untested so far, and
% WASAPI has only been tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10. For best
% results, use of Windows 10 is recommended.
%
% The Windows MME (MultiMediaExtensions) sound system has typical latencies
% and inaccuracies as high as 500 msecs. WASAPI can achieve latencies as
% low as 10 msecs with onboard sound chips on Windows-10, and maybe even on
% Windows 8.1. On Windows 7 latencies around 20 msecs are possible. Timing
% should be generally accurate to millisecond level with WASAPI.
%
% Using OSX or Linux will usually get you at least as good, or usually
% better, results with most standard sound hardware, due to the technically
% superior sound systems of these operating systems.

% History:
% 6/6/2007    Written (MK).
% 10/20/2011  Update: We always use ASIO enabled plugin on Windows by
%             default, as the PTB V3.0.9 MIT style license allows bundling
%             of an ASIO enabled proprietary dll with Psychtoolbox. (MK)
% 09/11/2012  Add support for 64-Bit portaudio_x64.dll for Windows. (MK)
% 10/16/2015  Disable use of our own portaudio_x64 dll On Windows + Octave. (MK)
% 11/08/2018  No ASIO anymore, starting with v3.0.15. (MK)
% 10/22/2019  Print merely helpful info (not error or warning) only if 
%             Verbosity>3. denis.pelli@nyu.edu

% The usual tricks for MS-Windows:
if IsWin
    % Override driver installed?
    if exist([PsychtoolboxRoot 'portaudio_x86.dll'], 'file') || exist([PsychtoolboxRoot 'portaudio_x64.dll'], 'file')
        % Yes! Use override driver:
        if PsychPortAudio('Verbosity')>3
            fprintf('Detected optional PortAudio override driver plugin in Psychtoolbox root folder. Will use that.\n');
        end
        driverloadpath = PsychtoolboxRoot;
    else
        % No - We use our standard driver:
        driverloadpath = [PsychtoolboxRoot 'PsychSound'];
    end

    % Standard path trick: Change working directory to driver load path,
    % preinit PsychPortAudio so it gets linked against the proper DLL,
    % change path back to old current directory:
    try
        olddir = pwd;
        cd(driverloadpath);
        % We force loading+linking+init of the driver:
        d = PsychPortAudio('GetDevices');
        cd(olddir);
    catch %#ok<*CTCH>
        cd(olddir);
        error(['Failed to load PsychPortAudio driver for unknown reason! '...
